# Calculator v 2

This is my solution for the simple Calculator exercise, with the
added code to retain the state of the result displayed on the screen

result is in a TextView so it is the programmer's responsibility to save
and restore it as needed

override 
onSaveInstanceState()
and
onRestoreInstanceState()

also
added Logging of the two methods & the result
